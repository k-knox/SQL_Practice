# SQL Practice: Answering Business Questions using MySQL 

## Overview: 

In this project I will be demonstrating MySQL skills by answering a variety of practice business questions. 

### Scenario 

Iâ€™m co-owner of a recently acquired movie rental business **Maven Movies**. As a new owner I need to have a deep understanding of my organization, which means conducting a basic exploratory analysis of my product inventory, staff, and customer purchasing behaviors.

## Exploratory Queries (no questions)

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT

    CASE
        WHEN rental_duration <= 4 THEN 'Rental too short'
        WHEN rental_rate >= 3.99 THEN 'Too expensive'
        WHEN rating IN('NC-17', 'R') THEN 'Too adult'
        WHEN length NOT BETWEEN 60 AND 90 THEN 'Too short or too long'
        WHEN description LIKE '%Shark%' THEN 'Nope, has sharks'
        ELSE 'Great for my neice!'
    END AS Fit_For_Recommendations
FROM film;
```

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CASE
        WHEN store_id = 1 AND active = 1 THEN 'Store 1 Active'
        WHEN store_id = 1 AND active = 0 THEN 'Store 1 Inactive'
        WHEN store_id = 2 AND active = 1 THEN 'Store 2 Active'
        WHEN store_id = 2 AND active = 0 THEN 'Store 2 Inactive'
        ELSE 'Nope, check logic!'
    END AS store_and_status
FROM customer;
```

```sql
SELECT
    film_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN store_id = 1 THEN inventory_id ELSE NULL END) AS Store_1_Copies,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN store_id = 2 THEN inventory_id ELSE NULL END) AS Store_2_Copies,
    COUNT(inventory_id) AS Total_Copies
FROM inventory
GROUP BY film_id
ORDER BY film_id;
```

```sql
SELECT
    store_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN active = 1 THEN customer_id ELSE NULL END) AS Active,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN active = 0 THEN customer_id ELSE NULL END) AS Inactive
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id;
```
